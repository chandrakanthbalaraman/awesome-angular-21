# Module 01: Signals Deep Dive

> **Duration**: 1.5 weeks | **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Understand why Signals were introduced in Angular
- Create and manipulate signals with `signal()`, `set()`, `update()`
- Derive state with `computed()`
- Handle side effects with `effect()`
- Use modern input/output/query patterns
- Bridge Signals and RxJS with `toSignal()` / `toObservable()`
